# GitHub Stars Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the number of stars a GitHub repository will receive based on various repository features. The model uses regression techniques such as XGBoost and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the number of stars a GitHub repository will receive. The dataset includes several features related to repository characteristics, such as the number of forks, issues, and the repository's creation date. The model was built to identify patterns and insights into the factors that contribute to a repository's popularity.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- Transformed the target variable, **'Stars'**, using a logarithmic scale to normalize its distribution.

### Modeling:
- Trained various machine learning models, including **Random Forest**, **Lasso Regression**, and **XGBoost**.
- Applied regularization techniques in the models to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) and **RÂ²** (coefficient of determination).

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** to find optimal hyperparameters and fine-tune model performance.

### Error Analysis:
- Analyzed the residuals (prediction errors) after training the models to explore potential improvements.
- Investigated patterns in the errors to inform future refinements and enhance model accuracy.
