# GitHub Stars Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the number of stars a GitHub repository will receive based on various features. The model utilizes regression techniques, including XGBoost, and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the number of stars a GitHub repository will receive, based on various characteristics such as the number of forks, issues, commits, and other repository-related features. The model analyzes these factors to provide insights into what contributes to a repository's popularity.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Handling Missing Values and Outliers**: Cleaned the data to handle missing values and outliers effectively.
- **Log Transformation**: Applied a logarithmic transformation to the target variable **'Stars'** to normalize its distribution.

### Model Training:
- Trained multiple machine learning models, including **Random Forest**, **Lasso Regression**, and **XGBoost**.
- Applied **regularization** to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) and **RÂ²** (coefficient of determination).

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** to optimize the models' hyperparameters and improve performance.

### Error Analysis:
- Analyzed residuals (errors between predicted and actual values) to identify areas of improvement and refine the model.
- Investigated patterns in prediction errors to enhance future iterations.
